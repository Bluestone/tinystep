Contributing
-----------

There are two wonderful ways you can contribute to Tinystep: filing issues and
submitting pull requests.

## Filing Issues

Filing a GitHub issue can be used for when you want to ask any questions,
start discussions, or file actual bugs within Tinystep. There are issue
templates to guide you through most issues, if you do not see your issue
feel free to simply give the information you believe is relevant in the
other category.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you choose to contribute a pull request to Tinystep, following these
guidelines will make things easier for you and for us:

 - Your pull request should generally not be force-pushed too. This creates
   a mess in github notifications. We will squash all of the commits down, feel
   free to have as many train of thoughts as you want.

 - Your commit message should follow this general format:

   ```
   ## Motivation ##
    Summary of the commit (Subject)

    Further explanation of the commit, generally focusing on why you chose
    the approach you did in making this change.

    closes gh-123 (if this closes a GitHub Issue)

  ## Test Plan ##

      - Use this space to enumerate steps that need to be taken to test this commit
   ```

It should be noted your test will not be tested until you receive an,
`/ok-to-test` from a maintainer.
